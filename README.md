Login Netflix | HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT - PHP

In this project, I've created a fully functional login form using HTML for the page structure, CSS for styling, and PHP to drive the login logic. The goal of this project is to provide a basic and clear example of how a login can be implemented on a web page.

The login form is designed with a simple and easy to use structure, allowing the user to enter their username and password. Validation functions have been included to ensure correct values ​​are entered into the form before login information is submitted.

The use of PHP in this project allows the user to enter their login information and validate it on the server. If the information is correct, the user will be redirected to the home page; otherwise, an error message will be displayed.

This project can be used as a base to build a more advanced and complex login system on any website that uses PHP, HTML and CSS. I hope it's useful for those looking to learn how to implement a login on a web page.
